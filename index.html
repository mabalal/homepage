      <p>Every man in the world has a favorite place to go.  Where he captive his mind, feels comfortable and safe. Place to go in times of sadness. A place to throw concerns away or a place that may remind you of beautiful memories and you love sitting in it reminiscences those moments. Also it may be a place to change the mood.
Sea is that horizon that takes you to another world, where you reminiscences your beautiful memories, which gives you the psychological comfort and happiness with its breaking waves.
The sea is one of the most beautiful blessings for man, which shows the greatness of the Creator.  Words can’t describe the sea beauty and charm, which is an inspiration to many poets and writers. Poems and thoughts that talked about sea are uncountable.
The beach is my favorite place. Sit down to relax and think. I also go to it to practice many activities and games.
I join my friends in playing treasure hunt in the sand, which is based on hiding various objects down the sand and writing instructions on paper cards to help others reach them.
I build sand in the form of castles, palaces and compete with my friends to choose the ideal building design.
